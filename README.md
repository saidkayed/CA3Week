# CA3Week

Frontend:

Before starting the frontend application one must open a terminal window and navigate to the CA3Frontend folder and write these 7 lines:

npm install

npm install react-bootstrap-table-next

npm install bootstrap@4.0.0

npm install react-bootstrap-table2-filter

npm install react-bootstrap-table2-paginator

npm install dk_test_names Note: this line is only necessary if you do not already have dk_test_names installed on your system.

npm install json-server Note: this line is only necessary if you do not already have Json-server installed on your system.


Backend:

The backend is hosted at a droplet with URL: https://www.sado-net.com/ca3/

It contains a MySQL database with a few preset usernames and the necessary POJOs to authenticate logins through the Frontend.

App:

Ensure you have Expo installed on your phone.

Go to https://expo.io/@saiskayed/CA3App and scan the QR code with your Expo app.
